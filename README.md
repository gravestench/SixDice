# SixDice
SixDice is a conversion utility that is intended to convert DCC and DC6 files to and from other 
image formats.  

## Disclaimer
1. There are some unclear bugs with the file format implementations, so the implementations should
   not be considered a gold-standard. Instead, they should be used as a useful starting point.
1. SixDice was written around the time that Java 1.5 was the current release, circa 2004. The 
   software industry has moved on and there are many patterns and practices that have become 
   well-established in the time since. As such, the code in this repository should not be used as an
   example of a well-designed GUI application. For instance, it does not follow any user interface 
   design pattern e.g. MVC.
